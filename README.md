## Too many F's in the chat

I'm a bad [streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/warp_tux), with a highly irregular schedule.
Here's the thing--that's because my internet sucks.

Every step along the way, my Xfinity service, my Google WiFi router, my network portal online--they all say I'm getting 500mbps down and 30mbps up.
But when I try to stream, I get 0.1-0.5mbps up.
This is across several devices, and ethernet is not (currently) an option.

## Under Construction

This tool will serve two purposes:

1. help me diagnose the broken part of the chain (I'm pretty sure it's the Google WiFi router to blame, not the Xfinity gateway!)
1. notify me when my internet drops immediately (using dbus notifications, i.e. dunst) and when it's restored since video calls basically just drop out.

If you want to contribute, be my guest! Keep in mind this repo will serve my use case, I'm happy to support others.
